# sales-frequency-tracking
This program takes in a .txt file as input and outputs a .txt file with each item followed by the number of times it appears, as well as being able to give the number of times a specific item appears, or print a histogram showing the frequency of each item.
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  For this poject, the problem was that a client had a list of sales for the day and wanted to be able to see how often each type of item was selling.
What did you do particularly well?
  In this project it would have been fairly easy to maintain most of the code in the main() function without utilizing the class member functions, however I believe that I did a fairly good    job of keeping much of the functionality in the class' member functions. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  The code in its current state will only work so long as each item sold is exactly one word. adding in the ability to have multi-word items would greatly increase the utility of the program.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging aspect of this program was finding how to incorporate a class into the program. The project requirements required a class, however I am unsure whether the implemented    class was beneficial over defining the functions in main(). To overcome this, I did more research into how classes function and I plan to keep this study material to reference as needed      throughout my continued work.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  This class was my first introduction to the c++ programming language and while it took some time to warm up to, I believe it will be a great asset in my future coding projects. While the     ideas presented in this class were not new to me, the syntax and implementation in this language were and helped to solidify the core principles into my coding style, regardlesss of the      language used.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I helped to make this program readable and maintainable by using in-line comments and relevant naming conventions. It is adaptable due to not being too specific in its implementation and     any of the class member functions should be able to be easily modified without concern for introducing bugs.
